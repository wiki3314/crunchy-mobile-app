# AddPost Issues - Fixed âœ…

## Date: October 18, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. âœ… Image Upload Progress Not Showing (0% stuck issue)

**Problem:**

- Progress was stuck at 0% during image/video uploads
- Progress callback parameter was named incorrectly
- Progress reset timing was wrong

**Solution:**

- Fixed `onUploadProgress` callback parameter name from `progress` to `progressEvent`
- Added null check: `if (progressEvent.total)` to prevent NaN errors
- Reset progress to 0 at the START of upload (before showing modal)
- Keep final reset at the END (after hiding modal) for cleanup
- Added detailed console logs for debugging

**Files Changed:**

- `src/Screens/AddPost.js` - Lines 248-262, 281-308, 335-362, 380-407, 452-479

**Result:**
âœ… Progress now updates from 0% â†’ 100% properly during uploads

---

### 2. âœ… Google Places Autocomplete Not Showing Results

**Problem:**

- Restaurant search was not displaying results
- `listViewDisplayed={false}` was hiding the dropdown
- Query type was too restrictive
- Missing proper configuration

**Solution:**

- Changed `listViewDisplayed={false}` to `listViewDisplayed="auto"`
- Changed query type from `"restaurant"` to `"establishment"` (more inclusive)
- Added `nearbyPlacesAPI="GooglePlacesSearch"`
- Added `debounce={400}` for better performance
- Added `minLength={2}` to start searching after 2 characters
- Added proper styling for `listView` with white background
- Added separator styling (1px grey line)
- Added `onFail` error handler for debugging
- Added `placeholderTextColor` for better UX
- Added console logs for debugging

**Files Changed:**

- `src/Screens/AddPost.js` - Lines 611-681

**Result:**
âœ… Google Places now shows restaurant suggestions in a dropdown list

---

### 3. âœ… Post API Not Working - Field Mismatch

**Problem:**

- Frontend was sending `review` field but backend expects `description`
- Images were being sent as objects instead of URL strings
- Missing `location` field
- No error handling for failed API calls
- No response validation

**Solution:**

- Changed `review` to `description` in API payload
- Extract image URLs: `uploadedImages.map(img => img.url)`
- Added `location` field (set to restaurant name)
- Added try-catch block for error handling
- Added response validation: `if (response && response.success)`
- Show error message if API call fails
- Added detailed console logs for debugging

**Request Object Format (Fixed):**

```javascript
{
  description: "Review text",           // Changed from 'review'
  rating: 4.5,
  latitude: 40.7128,
  longitude: -74.0060,
  user_id: 123,
  category_id: 5,
  restaurant: "Restaurant Name",
  restaurant_id: "ChIJxxxxx",
  images: ["path/to/image1.jpg", ...], // Changed from objects to strings
  location: "Restaurant Name"           // Added this field
}
```

**Files Changed:**

- `src/Screens/AddPost.js` - Lines 157-211

**Result:**
âœ… Posts are now created/updated successfully with proper error handling

---

### 4. âœ… API Handler - Better Error Handling

**Problem:**

- API errors were only logged with console.log
- No error messages returned to UI
- No detailed error information

**Solution:**

- Added comprehensive try-catch with proper error returns
- Return `{ success: false, message: ... }` on errors
- Added detailed console logs for debugging
- Added Content-Type headers
- Log both request and response for debugging

**Files Changed:**

- `src/Constants/apiHandler.js` - Lines 267-291 (addPost)
- `src/Constants/apiHandler.js` - Lines 327-351 (updatePost)

**Result:**
âœ… Better error messages shown to users when API calls fail

## Console Logs Added for Debugging

When testing, check console for these logs:

1. **Google Places:**

   - "Selected Place Details:" - when restaurant is selected
   - "Restaurant Row Data:" - for each dropdown item
   - "Google Places Error:" - if API fails

2. **Upload Progress:**

   - "Progress is X%" + loaded/total bytes
   - Should show incremental progress

3. **Post API:**
   - "Post Request Object:" - shows payload being sent
   - "Add Post API Request:" - API handler level log
   - "Add Post API Response:" - shows backend response
   - "Post Save Error:" - if API call fails

---

## Backend API Endpoints Used

- **POST** `/api/post-save` - Create new post
- **POST** `/api/post-update/:id` - Update existing post
- **POST** `/api/imageupload` - Upload media files
- **POST** `/api/removeImage` - Delete media files

---

## Notes

1. Google Places API Key is hardcoded: `AIzaSyC67cbOCHYz64VdKTn2oOnzxM9sVKm-lQY`

   - Make sure this key is active and has Places API enabled
   - Should be moved to environment variables in production

2. Backend expects these required fields:

   - `description` (string) - The review text
   - `category_id` (number) - Food category ID

3. Backend accepts these optional fields:
   - `images` (string[]) - Array of image URLs
   - `location` (string) - Restaurant location
   - `rating` (number) - Star rating
   - `latitude` (number) - GPS coordinates
   - `longitude` (number) - GPS coordinates
   - `restaurant_id` (string) - Google Place ID
